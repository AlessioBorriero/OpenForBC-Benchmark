# CIFAR100 classification benchmark with convolutional neural network

## Introduction:

This benchmark implements a deep Convolutional Neural Netowrk and perform training and inference over CIFAR100 dataset. From presets is also possible to select real time data augmentation.

## Presets:

Through the presets json files it's possible to choose number of epochs, data augmentation (yes or no) and device used by the benchmark (GPU or CPU). Data Augmentation consists of a generator that converts training sample in augmented ones during training.

## Devices supported:

The device (GPU or CPU) is selected through presets.

## Dependencies installation

The benchmark dependencies are automatically installed by the benchmark.
